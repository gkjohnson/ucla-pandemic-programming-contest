# ucla-pandemic-programming-contest
My submission and associated files for the 2009 UCLA Pandemic Programming Contest. Repo includes the context [rules and game files](UCLA-Pandemic%20Programming%20Contest.zip) and [my AI bot](GarrBot.cpp). The contest involved writing the AI for a bot running in the [Saurbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/) game engine and competing with other students in a bracket.

I did not win.
